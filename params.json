With Cloggy,all administration activities will be separated by modules. In addition to administration, Cloggy also provides a MySql database structure to facilitate developer / programmer to manage their content following the concept of node in Drupal. \r\n\r\n### Main Purpose\r\nThe main purpose of this plugin is to cut time development by providing and sharing many modules to reuse again and also structured database schema to manage general content. You can choose Cloggy as your administration area without using Cloggy database (using your own) to manage your own content, or otherwise you can using Cloggy database without using adminstrator features, it's flexible!\r\n\r\n### Limitations\r\n**Cloggy is not a CMS!** Cloggy just provide a general function of website administration such as for blogging, users management, and others, but you cannot manage your frontend from here, except you create your own modules. My purpose here is to give flexibility for other programmers to manage their own frontend, and also share modules (for administration) between programmers.\r\n\r\n### Authors\r\nThis project created and maintaned by @hiraq\r\n\r\n### LICENSE\r\n**MIT License**\r\n\r\nCloggy - Modular Admin And Structured Content (http://hiraq.github.com/Cloggy)\r\nCopyright (c) 2012, Hiraq Citra Mahardika\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
