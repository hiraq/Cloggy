        <h3>About Cloggy.</h3>

<p>Cloggy is a plugin for CakePHP for website administration. With Cloggy,all administration activities will be separated by modules. In addition to administration, Cloggy also provides a MySql database structure to facilitate developer / programmer to manage their content following the concept of node in Drupal. </p>

<h3>Main Purpose</h3>

<p>The main purpose of this plugin is to cut time development by providing and sharing many modules to reuse again and also structured database schema to manage general content. You can choose Cloggy as your administration area without using Cloggy database (using your own) to manage your own content, or otherwise you can using Cloggy database without using adminstrator features, it's flexible!</p>

<h3>Limitations</h3>

<p><strong>Cloggy is not a CMS!</strong> Cloggy just provide a general function of website administration such as for blogging, users management, and others, but you cannot manage your frontend from here, except you create your own modules. My purpose here is to give flexibility for other programmers to manage their own frontend, and also share modules (for administration) between programmers.</p>
